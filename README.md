# CI/CD Pipeline in Python 🧺as🚀

This is a minimal Python project demonstrating continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) using **GitHub Actions**. It includes automated testing with `pytest`, linting with `flake8`, and a placeholder for deployment.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`) runs on:

- **Pushes and PRs to `main`**
- **Steps include**:
  - Set up Python 3.10
  - Install dependencies
  - Lint code with `flake8`
  - Run unit tests with `pytest`
  - (Optional) Deploy after successful build

> Customize the `Deploy` step to suit your environment (e.g., SSH, rsync, or cloud deployment).
